Absolutely! Let’s build a full client-facing workshop + engagement plan, now including:

Stakeholder interviews
Current-state assessment
Platform design
Codeium/Windsurf evaluation
Detailed deliverables
New schedule and activities
I'll also generate a presentation deck outline you could easily flesh out.

📋 Full Week Plan for Client Workshops and Activities

Purpose: Establish a shared UI platform vision using AI tools like Windsurf and Codeium with Micro-frontends in ReactJS (and possibly Angular).

5-Day Detailed Schedule

🗓️ Day 1: Stakeholder Alignment + Current Application Landscape

Objective: Understand the current application ecosystem and gather expectations.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:00	Kick-off + Goals Alignment
10:00–11:30	Stakeholder Interviews (PMs, Architects, Dev leads) – capture pain points, goals, in-flight work
11:30–12:30	Working Session #1: Tech Stack + App Architecture Discovery (document current frameworks, deployment models)
1:30–3:30	Hands-on Workshop: Application walkthrough - understand modules, user flows
3:30–5:00	Initial Assessment: Identify potential micro-frontend boundaries and gaps

🗓️ Day 2: Component Analysis + Platform Strategy

Objective: Discover reuse potential and begin defining the shared platform.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:30	Review Existing Components: Analyze reusable presentation components across apps.
10:45–12:00	Working Session #2: Define Component Reuse Criteria (taxonomy, documentation standards, test requirements).
1:00–3:00	Inventory Working Session: Build a draft component inventory with client team input.
3:00–5:00	Discussion: Evaluate feasibility of cross-framework (React + Angular) component sharing.

🗓️ Day 3: Logical Architecture + Micro-Frontend Approaches

Objective: Define future-state logical structure and delivery patterns.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:30	Design Logical Architecture: App shells, Micro-frontends, Shared services.
10:30–12:00	Shared Platform Capabilities: Authentication, Error handling, Feature flags, Logging standards.
1:00–3:00	Micro-Frontend Strategy: Module Federation, Composition layer, Runtime contracts.
3:00–5:00	Working Session: Mapping current apps to micro-frontend slices.

🗓️ Day 4: AI-Powered Development and Code Reuse

Objective: Evaluate AI tools for scaling platform development efficiently.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:30	Introduction to Codeium and Windsurf
10:45–12:30	PoC Exercise: Use Codeium to refactor sample code and measure productivity gains.
1:30–3:00	Generate Components with Windsurf: Create presentation components automatically.
3:00–5:00	Comparison and Recommendation: Windsurf vs Codeium for component reuse acceleration.

🗓️ Day 5: Synthesis, Roadmap, and Deliverables Presentation

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Objective: Consolidate findings, finalize deliverables, define MVP.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:30	Finalization of Component Inventory and Taxonomy
10:30–12:00	Logical Architecture Blueprint Review
1:00–3:00	Define Platform MVP Scope
3:00–4:00	Technical Feasibility Assessment: Cross-framework component reuse (React/Angular).
4:00–5:00	Executive Readout & Workshop Closure

🔥 Notes for Consultants Running These Sessions

Bring live examples wherever possible.
Pre-generate 2-3 Windsurf components to show the time savings.
Keep stakeholder interviews structured but allow open questions to uncover unknowns.
During workshops, keep a "Parking Lot" for out-of-scope but important topics.
Would you like me to also generate a sample Logical Architecture Diagram template you can show the client? 🚀 It would complete your kit nicely!
(React Shell + Micro-frontend slices + Shared Platform layer layout.)
