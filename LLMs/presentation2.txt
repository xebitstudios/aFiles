Absolutely — I’ll create a practical, senior-consultant-level weekly plan for you.

You're introducing:

Micro-frontends with ReactJS
AI tools (like Windsurf — an AI for automating frontend development, component generation, testing, etc.)
📋 5-Day Client Workshop and Activity Plan

Goal: Enable client team to understand how to design, build, and manage micro-frontends in React with AI support like Windsurf.
🗓️ Day 1: Foundation Day – Setting Context

Objective: Align on goals, introduce micro-frontends and AI in development.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:00	Kick-off: Project objectives, Why Micro-Frontends, Why AI now?
10:15–11:45	Concept Deep Dive: Micro-frontend architecture patterns (vertical slices, team autonomy, composition strategies).
1:00–2:30	Hands-on Workshop: Traditional vs Micro-frontend React architecture (simple examples)
3:00–4:00	Introduction to Windsurf AI: Live demo - generating a simple React component and unit tests via Windsurf.
4:00–5:00	Q&A / Open Discussion: Capture current team concerns and goals.
🗓️ Day 2: Designing Micro-frontends + Introducing AI

Objective: Help teams start designing micro-frontends, introduce AI assistance in design stage.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:30	Workshop: Breaking a Monolith – Design Exercise (Break a sample app into micro-frontends).
10:45–12:00	Windsurf in Design: How AI tools can auto-generate component diagrams, UI contracts, and APIs.
1:00–2:30	Hands-on: Use Windsurf to generate component scaffolding for each micro-frontend.
3:00–4:00	Peer Review: Teams review each other’s micro-frontend designs using Windsurf outputs.
4:00–5:00	Reflections / Adjustments: Document learnings, what works/doesn’t.
🗓️ Day 3: Building and Integrating with AI Support

Objective: Build initial working micro-frontends using Windsurf to speed up repetitive tasks.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:00	Micro-frontend Communication: Shared libraries, contracts, event buses (short lecture + demo).
10:15–12:00	Windsurf in Build Phase: Code generation, test generation, storybook generation.
1:00–3:00	Hands-on Coding: Teams build 1-2 micro-frontends from scratch with Windsurf helping:
- Generate components
- Auto-create Jest/React Testing Library unit tests
- Generate Storybook stories
3:15–4:30	Demo Sharing: Show early work from each team.
4:30–5:00	Best Practices Discussion (capturing lessons learned).
🗓️ Day 4: AI for Testing, CI/CD, Deployment Automation

Objective: Show how AI like Windsurf supports quality automation (tests, pipelines).


Time	Activity
9:00–10:00	Testing Micro-frontends: Contract tests, component tests, e2e tests with Cypress.
10:15–12:00	Hands-on: Use Windsurf to generate test cases for new/existing components.
1:00–2:00	CI/CD Pipelines for Micro-frontends: How to independently build/deploy with Vite/Webpack Module Federation.
2:00–3:30	Workshop: Generate Github Actions or GitLab CI pipelines using Windsurf suggestions.
3:30–5:00	Practice Deployments: Deploy a simple micro-frontend app into a shared shell/container.
🗓️ Day 5: Scaling, Governance, AI Strategy

Objective: Establish future vision, governance and scaling strategies.


Time	Activity
9:00–10:30	Scaling Micro-frontends: Design standards, versioning, ownership models.
10:45–12:00	Using AI for Long-Term Governance: Code consistency, styleguide enforcement with Windsurf.
1:00–3:00	Team Planning Exercise: Each team writes a "Micro-Frontend + AI Usage Charter":
- When/where to use Windsurf
- Guardrails, manual overrides
- AI-assisted reviews/merges
3:00–4:00	Final Demo + Retro: Showcase the week’s work, feedback session.
4:00–5:00	Next Steps Planning: Formalize path for full project kickoff.
🛠️ Materials Needed

Pre-installed: NodeJS, React CLI, Storybook
Windsurf (or similar AI tool) access configured for teams
Sample app/domain to "microfrontend-ize"
Access to GitHub/GitLab for CI/CD examples
CI pipelines templates
🧠 Key Consulting Best Practices Throughout the Week:

Daily retros — 10 min end of each day to gather feedback and adapt.
Balance between lecture and hands-on — keep lectures max 60–90 min.
Capture blockers in a visible place (Miro board, Whiteboard, etc.).
Visible success — Teams must build and demo real artifacts by Day 3–4.
Sponsor touchpoints — Daily 15-min sync with client sponsors to show progress and adjust.
