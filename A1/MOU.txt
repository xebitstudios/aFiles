Create a Memorandum of understanding document to be signed by each contributing partner intending to fund a 8-month Habanero growing season for an agricultural company called Wilshire Farms and Orchards, the farm is also a contributing partner and will provide the green house facility, infrastructure like water and staff quarters. Other types of contributing partners include just monetary partners that invest money and monitoring partners that will invest money and also be responsible for visiting the farm at least once in 2 weeks to assess the work done by staff and make sure tasks are being done. The total investment amount will cover staff salaries for the 8 months, all plant feed, pesticide and herbicides costs, greenhouse materials like ropes and clips cost and transport expense for each trip the monitoring partners make to the farm. Once the harvesting period starts, the produce will be sold and the money distributed back to the partners based on the percentage invested. tThis will go on until the investing period/season is over and the plants terminated. Add other MOU details that will protect each investing partner and make this agreement binding once signed.
